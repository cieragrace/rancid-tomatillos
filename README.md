# Rotten Tomatillos

### Abstract - what we did
We have developed an application that showcases a diverse collection of movies, which users can browse through by either searching or scrolling. The movies are sourced from a RESTful API, and users can select any movie to view its details. Our app is designed to be user-friendly for individuals with colorblindness and dyslexia. Additionally, we have achieved a 96% accessibility score on Lighthouse.
